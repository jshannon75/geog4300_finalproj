title: "Geog4/6300: Final project"
output: github_document
---

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

Here’s what each project will need to include:
A clearly-framed, precise research question that requires techniques discussed in class
An element of descriptive/exploratory analysis: graphing central tendency/distribution or mapping out data to identify potential spatial patterns
At least one inferential test (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, correlation, regression)

The final project should be an R Markdown document that is in the following format:

Research question: A brief explanation of the question you’re trying to answer.
* Data: The data you’re using for this assignment, including the source of the data (if known) and the main variables of interest
* Methods: A description of the methods you’re using to answer your research question, with an explanation of why these particular techniques are most appropriate
* Analysis: The actual tests/graphs described in the methods section. Be sure that the output of your test is visible on the knitted document, and explain what the results of each test or the patterns visible on each graphic mean.
* Discussion: How you would answer your research question based on your results.
* Self-reflection: Your own evaluation of this final assignment and how it demonstrates what you’ve learned this semester.

Your proposal (due by class on 11/30) should include the research question, data, and methods sections. Tag me in an issue on Github when you’re done. This is a chance to get my input before you get into the actual analysis.

I'll leave feedback in the "Issues" tab and tag you for both the proposal and final project.
